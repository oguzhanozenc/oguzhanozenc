# Hey, I'm Oguzhan ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a front-end developer who blends thoughtful design with solid structure to build interfaces that feel intuitive and cohesive.

My approach is shaped by a product-first mindset â€” one that values clarity, usability, and maintainability just as much as visual polish. I care about creating systems that are visually consistent, scalable, and easy to work with â€” both for users and developers. I enjoy refining components, designing flexible layouts, and integrating modern tools that make products feel simple and purposeful.
